                <div><p>Board Dungeon Delving - A Roguelike Adventure Game by Eric Edwards</p>
                <p>What was supposed to be a 3 person team project turned into a solo project as my final for Game Elements. Currently continuing work to make a publishable version.</p>

                <div><p>Game Designer Hell by Eric Edwards, Thomas Martin, and Geno Mcgahee</p>
                <p>A card game that plays similarly to Aye Dark Overlord. I worked on the initial design/rules and graphics.</p>

                <div><p>Salmon Clicker by Eric Edwards, Tye Oulette, Ryan Griffin, Amelia Paige, and Lucas Cerqueira</p>
                <p>A clicker game made for the incremental game jam of spring 2023, I designed the game, managed the project/timeline and did the initial math (most of which was redone by Lucas as my formulas got out of hand.)</p>

                <div><p>Dungeons and Dragons custom made campaign and world by Eric Edwards</p>
                <p>This isn't everything I've designed for the multiple campaigns that will be set in this world, this is just only what I can share without my players seeing things they aren't supposed to see. If any potential employers would like to see campaigns I've written up, I can share those separately.</p>

                <p>A website made by commission for my engineering teacher who runs the tri-county strutters branch of the NWTF. I worked on the frontend and bug fixing while my partner Ryan Griffin worked on the backend.</p>

                <div>
                <p>A website made by commission for the Rich Baptist Church located in Northborough. We initially made this website design and started working on non web dev backend (banking, donations, etc.) but eventually fell through on the project due to lack of communication from the client. I worked mostly on frontend and talking to the client while my partner Ryan Griffin worked on the backend and style cleanup.</p>
