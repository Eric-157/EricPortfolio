                <p>I am Eric Edwards (18), a double major student at Fitchburg State University, studying Game Design and Computer Science with a concentration in Game Programming. I've been a long time gamer, starting all the way back to when I was 3. By middle school, I grew to love making things having joined the robotics team and programming the robot for my team. That would ultimately lead me to Assabet Valley, where I would learn more about programming through FIRST Robotics, and join the computer programming shop where I would find my creative passion not in programming games, but designing them. Since then I've self taught myself the basics of game design and pixel art, and got familiar with unity. Now I use my skills to design games, create entire worlds through the ongoing DND campaign I've been creating, and use the technical skills I've learned to teach others and tackle commissions, having completed 2 website commissions and building many computers. It's my goal to become game designer, preferably for a company that I engage with through their games.</p>

                <h2>FIRST Robotics Team 157</h2>
                <p>Was a student for 4 years, working majorly as a programmer learning Java. Became a programming lead junior year, and went on to be the Team Lead senior year. Robotics helped me through my social anxiety, giving me the courage to pursue public speaking. I picked up some skills along the way, leadership, teamwork, some knowledge about Java, and even some mechanical skills like repairing robots. Now that I've graduated, I am now a junior mentor on the team while in school, and will be helping the programming section during build seasons by teaching and troubleshooting programming.</p>
