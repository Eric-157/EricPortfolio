                <p>I am Eric Edwards (18), a double major student at Fitchburg State University, studying Game Design and Computer Science with a concentration in Game Programming. I've been a long time gamer, starting all the way back to when I was 3. By middle school, I grew to love making things having joined the robotics team and programming the robot for my team. That would ultimately lead me to Assabet Valley, where I would learn more about programming through FIRST Robotics, and join the computer programming shop where I would find my creative passion not in programming games, but designing them. Since then I've self taught myself the basics of game design and pixel art, and got familiar with unity. Now I use my skills to design games, create entire worlds through the ongoing DND campaign I've been creating, and use the technical skills I've learned to teach others and tackle commissions, having completed 2 website commissions and building many computers. It's my goal to become game designer, preferably for a company that I engage with through their games. Below this section is my certifications.</p>

                <h2>Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School</h2>
                <p>I went to Assabet Valley for 4 years, studying Computer Programming and Web Development as my trade of choice. I graduated as Valedictorian of my class and was Vice President of my school's chapter of the National Honors Society.</p>

                <h2>FIRST Robotics Team 157</h2>
                <p>Was a student for 4 years, working majorly as a programmer learning Java. Became a programming lead junior year, and went on to be the Team Lead senior year. Robotics helped me through my social anxiety, giving me the courage to pursue public speaking. I picked up some skills along the way, leadership, teamwork, some knowledge about Java, and even some mechanical skills like repairing robots. Now that I've graduated, I am now a junior mentor on the team while in school, and will be helping the programming section during build seasons by teaching and troubleshooting programming.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <h2>Assabet Valley IT Intern</h2>
                <p>Worked the 2021 and 2022 summers in Assabet's IT department as an intern. I handled the setup process of chromebooks, maintained classroom computers, made and loaded images over the network, fixed/replaced tech, and did lots of organizing and inventorying. Tech worked on includes all in one computers, laptops, desktops, printers, projectors, tvs, smartboards, and other miscellaneous equipment.</p>
                <h2>Fitchburg State Tour Guide</h2>
                <p>I currently work as a tour guide in the admissions office for Fitchburg State University. This job consists of giving tours to families, working the office desk taking calls, doing menial labor like acceptance letter creation, and working as a student ambassador for different on campus events. It's a great job for me to practice the equivalence of customer interaction as there is on the fly question answering and aiding people in navigating the campus or the website.</p>
                <h2>Fitchburg State UBMS Online Tutor</h2>
                <p>I also currently work as an online tutor for the Upward Bounds Math and Science department for Fitchburg State University. This job consists of teaching high schoolers a wide range of subjects depending on what they need help with for either homework, test studying, or simple curiosity. This job also entails monthly stem workshops that I help out with and will soon have the chance to run a few myself. I really wanted an education aspect to my majors, but since I would need to take extra classes and not graduate on time, I found that this was the next best option as I get real practice teaching students of all backgrounds to better my own teaching skills.</p>
